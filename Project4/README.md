# I399 Final Project Reflection 
## Recipe API

When developing this project, I first tested (using console.log) the api results by using fetch() to understand how the data is collected. After checking that, I created a async function to grab the data in JSON format and store it in a variable which I pass to my next function. The next function uses query calls to get the required data of the results found and inserted them onto the HTML page as buttons. On clicking these resulting buttons, you can view instructions and other details for the selected meal. I found it tricky to extract the ingredients and measure data but evenutally understood it by reading related content online. Next I added the random button for which I created a sepearte function to pull the resulting data as a JSON file, store it and pass it to the same function that creates button like results and so forth. Overall, I found it tricky to deal with the CSS formatting (I could have done better) however the crucial components did not take me long to figure out!

Thankyou so much Professor Erika and Dhruv for giving me the opportunity to learn JS. Even though the course took place online, I have truely learned a lot and hope to use my skills for future projects soon.
